# Critical Appraisal
# Part 1
# We implemented addP into the calculator, and along the way solved a few variable not in scope, and a few lacks accompany binding errors. 
# We tested the program many times, ensuring it was up to our quality.
# We learned a lot about the way Haskell functions from working on this assignment, most importantly understanding the inner-workingings of the language. 
# Part 2
# We added 6 operations to the calculator which include Division, Subtraction, Mod, Exponent(Raised), Square Root, and Negative
# Division - Mod were self explanatory; We decided to call Exponent Raised so there was no confusion in the code where Exp already existed
# Square Root we had to do some exploring and found out that floats would work in Haskell to represent something like Sqrt 10 where an integer answer doens't exist
# We improved our knowledge of haskell and found solutions to problems that surfaced when compiling
